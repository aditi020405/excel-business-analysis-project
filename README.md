# Monthly Employee Attendance Report – Excel Business Analysis Project

## Objective

To create a simple Excel-based system for recording and tracking **employee attendance for one full month**, using controlled dropdown inputs and structured data suitable for HR and management reporting.

---

## Step 1: Create the Attendance Sheet

### Sheet Name

**Monthly_Attendance**

This sheet is used to record daily attendance for employees.

---

## Step 2: Define Employee Details (Fixed Columns)

The following columns capture basic employee information:

* **Employee_ID**
* **Name**
* **Email**
* **Project** (Dropdown: Telus, Continental)

These details remain the same for all attendance records.

---

## Step 3: Add Date Column

* **Date** column is added to record attendance for each working day.
* Date selection is controlled using **Date Picker / Date format** in Excel.
* Attendance records are maintained **date-wise for one full month**.

Example:

* 01-March-2026
* 02-March-2026
* 03-March-2026
  *(continues for the entire month)*

---

## Step 4: Add Attendance Status (Dropdown)

### Column: Attendance_Status

Attendance is captured using a dropdown with the following values:

* **Present**
* **Absent**

This ensures consistent and error-free data entry.

---

## Step 5: Recording Monthly Attendance

* Each employee has **multiple rows**, one for each working day of the month.
* For every date:

  * Employee details are entered
  * Attendance status is selected (Present / Absent)

This creates a **complete attendance record for one month**.
